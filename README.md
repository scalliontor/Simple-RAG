#RAG

I'm learning to build a RAG project for the first time using:
- Upload a PDF document
- Split the content into fixed length chunks
- Generate embeddings using bkai-foundation-models/vietnamese-bi-encoder (for embedding) 
- Store and index embeddings into a vector database
- Use lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5 (for response) as the local LLM
- Enable chat-based querying through a RAG pipeline
